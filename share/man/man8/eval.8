.TH EVAL 8
.SH NAME
eval \- evals the provided strings in bash
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B eval
[-r|-e|-m]
.IR code...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B eval
executes code using the bash eval builtin. The code is executed in a subshell which will be able to see the global variables that shellby uses to figure out where to store data.

The evaled code will be killed after 60 seconds if it has not finished running.

Warning, you probably want to quote the whole string to eval as otherwise shellby is going to try and process flags.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -r
Eval the provided string, but don't privmsg the output back to the channel.
.IP -e
Place the code to be evaled inside a string which is echoed.

e.g. ./eval -e $RANDOM -> eval echo "$RANDOM"
.IP -m
Eval the provided string using the bash $(()) builtin. Note that this uses unquoted expansion on the provided arguments.
